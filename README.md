# Data Engineering Learning Log

This repository documents a structured and continuous practice of data engineering fundamentals using Python.

It serves as a long-term learning log focused on:
- Data cleaning and validation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Reusable Python utilities
- Clear separation between experimentation and production-like code

The goal is not to collect isolated exercises, but to build disciplined habits aligned with professional data engineering workflows.

## Scope

- Working with real and realistic datasets
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Exploratory analysis to understand data quality and structure
- Refactoring notebook logic into reusable Python modules

## Repository Structure

- notebooks/: exploratory analysis and experimentation
- src/: reusable Python functions and utilities
- data/: raw and processed datasets
